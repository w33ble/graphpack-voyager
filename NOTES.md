# Important info

- associated products
- product variants
- product measurements
- restrictions around availability
- inventory, is the product available for purchase
- don't forget about prodcut images
- not all products have a manufacturer SKU

- location(s) of a product, origin of production
  - useful metadata, just like environmental certifications

## Questions

- How do we tell what "attributes" make a product variant vs when it's actually just an attribute?
  - ex. GE color is a different SKU (variant) and PPG is not (attribute)
